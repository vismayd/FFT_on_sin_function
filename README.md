# FFT_on_sin_function
Sampling, Fourier transform, operations on sine waves with data visualization

# Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
Run the sinef.py program to see the graphs of sampling and fourier transformation operations on sine wave functions.
